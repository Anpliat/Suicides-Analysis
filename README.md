# Suicides Analysis

### Purpose
Use data on suicides to determine whether there is an increasing trend in Greece or, more importantly, whether Greece's behavior differs from that of other countries. 

*Note: We were supposed to create at most ten visualizations to present our opinion as convincingly and completely as possible, as well as an application using R-shiny with this data that will allow the interaction and options for a graph.*
